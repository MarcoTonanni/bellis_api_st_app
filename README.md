# Streamlit App for De Bellis Rei Publicae Romanae Django REST API
## An API serving and managing information about the wars of the Roman Republic

This is an app made with Streamlit with part of the CRUD available for the De Bellis APIS and with a friendly display of data.
In order to optimize the running of the Streamlit app and make less server requisitions, a hand-made, simple and efficient cache system was implemented.

Here you can access the [De Bellis Django REST API repository](https://github.com/MarcoTonanni/bellis_api)
